### Prerequisites
* npm (comes with node, http://nodejs.org/)
* Install Visual Studio Code on one of the supported platforms.
* Install version 2.x and prerequisites of the Azure Functions Core Tools, which is still in preview. (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-first-function-vs-code)

## Setup
1. run `npm i` to install the required packages


## Continuous deploy
* Azure's continuous deploy has been flakey. You may have to manually push the updates to azure after checking them in. Use the vscode plugin or Visual Studio to do so.
